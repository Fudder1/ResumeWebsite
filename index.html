                <h3>Signal and Motion Activated Gate Project </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using an Arduino, breadboard, stepper motors, 3D printed parts, and the various hardware required, programmed a motion activated gate to only open after a certain IR signal has been received.</li>
                    <li>An Infrared (IR) receiver is contantly monitoring for IR signals. If a certain wavelength of Infrared (IR) waves is received by an IR receiver, a stepper motor will activate to unlock the gate. If an incorrect wavelength is received nothing is done, and the gate is still on standby.</li>
                    <li>When the gate is unlocked, a motion detector will monitor for movement. If movement is detected, a stepper motor will activate to open the gate. If no motion is detected when the gate is unlocked for 5 seconds, the gate will lock.</li>
                    <li>An “Emergency Stop” button was implemented on the breadboard which will light up the appropriate LED, and stop any movement of the gate. It will hold this status until the button is pressed again, which will release movement.</li>
                    <li>An “Emergency Open” button was implemented on the breadboard which will light up the appropriate LED, open the gate, and keep the gate open until the button is pressed again.</li>
